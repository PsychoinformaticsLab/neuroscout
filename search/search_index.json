Neuroscout is a web-based platform for fast and flexible analysis of fMRI data. Motivation fMRI studies using complex naturalistic stimulation, such as movies or audio narratives, hold great promise to reveal the neural activity underlying dynamic real-world perception. However, this potential utility is constrained by the resource-intensive nature of fMRI analysis, and further exacerbated by the difficulty of encoding relevant events in rich, multi-modal stimuli. Neuroscout leverages state-of-the-art feature extraction tools to automatically extract hundreds of annotations from stimuli. We pair this with a flexible and easy-to-use web interface, enabling researchers to flexibly define and explore novel theoretical models. Analysis execution is achieved with no configuration using open neuroimaging standards, and containerized model-fitting pipelines, ensuring high portability across execution environments, including HPCs and the cloud. Finally, we make it easy for researchers to share their results with interactive publication-like reports via the NeuroVault repository. Where can I get more help? In this documentation, we'll walk you through building and executing your own analysis on neuroscout.org . In addition, the first time you use neuroscout.org, you will be given a tour of the interface. After the tour, be on the look out informational tooltips (\"i\" icon), provided throughout to clarify aspects of the user interface. Finally, please read the FAQ thoroughly! For usage questions not addressed here, please ask a question on NeuroStars . For bug reports, feature requests, feedback, etc., please open an issue on open an issue on GitHub .","title":"Home"},{"location":"#introduction","text":"","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"#what-is-neuroscout","text":"Neuroscout is a web-based platform for fast and flexible analysis of fMRI data.","title":"What is Neuroscout?"},{"location":"#motivation","text":"fMRI studies using complex naturalistic stimulation, such as movies or audio narratives, hold great promise to reveal the neural activity underlying dynamic real-world perception.

Yes! Note, however, that Neuroscout is a web-based engine for fMRI analysis specification; at the moment, we don't provide free computing resources for the execution of the resulting analysis bundles. I plan to publish results I've obtained using Neuroscout, how do I cite? After you generate an analysis, a \"Bibliography\" tab will be shown which will auto-generate a reference list for the dataset, feature extractors, and scientific software used for that analysis. In addition to these references, be sure to include the unique analysis ID associated with any results. Are there any restrictions on analyses I've created? Yes. By using Neuroscout, you agree that once you have finalized and \"compiled\" an analysis, the analysis can no longer be deleted from our system. If you wish to 'edit' an Analysis, you may clone the analysis, and make any desired changed on the forked version. Although analyses are by default not searchable by other users, any user with the private analysis ID may view your analysis. Also, in the event that you publish any results generated using the NeuroScout interface, you MUST provide a link to the corresponding analysis page(s) on the NeuroScout website. I have a naturalistic study I'd like to share on Neuroscout, how do I do so? Due to the financial cost of extracting features from multi-modal stimuli using external APIs, the set of datasets we support is manually curated. However, we are continually expanding the list of supported datasets, and we encourage researchers to contact us if they want to make their data available for use in Neuroscout. Note that it is much easier for us to ingest datasets that are already deposited in the OpenNeuro repository, and we we strongly recommend uploading your dataset to OpenNeuro whether or not it eventually ends up in Neuroscout. I want to make changes to an analysis I already ran, but it is locked. How can I edit it? Once an analysis has been run, it is permanently locked and archived for provenance. You may \"clone\" your analysis, and make changes to this new copy of your analysis. I want to make one of my \"private\" analyses public, but the website says the analysis is \"locked\"! When an analysis is locked, you can no longer make any substantive changes that affect model specification. However, you can always edit the name, description, and public/private status. So go ahead and make your analysis public! How do you automatically extract features from naturalistic datasets? The original stimuli presented to users are submitted to various machine learning algorithms and services to extract novel feature timecourses. To facility this process, we have developed a Python library for multimodal feature extraction called pliers. Pliers allows us to extract a wide-variety of features across modalities using various external content analysis services with ease. For example, we are able to use Google Vision API to encode various aspects of the visual elements of movie frames, such as when a face is present. In addition, pliers allows us to easily link up various feature extraction services; for example, we can use the IBM Watson Speech to Text API to transcribe the speech in a movie into words with precise onsets, and then use a predefined dictionary of lexical norms to extract lexical norms for each word, such as frequency. We can then generate timecourses for each of these extracted features, creating novel predictors of brain activity. For more information of pliers, please see the GitHub repository and the following paper: McNamara, Q., De La Vega, A., & Yarkoni, T. (2017, August). Developing a comprehensive framework for multimodal feature extraction. In Proceedings of the 23rd ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (pp. 1567-1574). ACM. Am I restricted to mass univariate GLMs, or can I use Neuroscout to specify other kinds of analyses? Currently, that is the case. However,the underlying BIDS-StatsModel is designed with more complex models in mind, such as predictive and linear-mixed effect models","title":"FAQ"},{"location":"faq/#frequently-asked-questions","text":"","title":"Frequently Asked Questions"},{"location":"faq/#is-this-service-free-to-use","text":"Yes!

This doesn't have to be a unique name (although that might be helpful), and you can always change it later. Optionally, also give your analysis a description . If you make many analyses, this could be very helpful. Choosing a dataset Neuroscout currently indexes a curated set of nine public naturalstic fMRI datasets. Datasets were specifically chosen for their compliance to the BIDS standard, and availability of original naturalistic stimuli. You can find detailed information on each dataset by clicking on the blue link icon. All datasets are minimally preprocessed using fmriprep 1.2.2 or greater, and ready for model fitting. If you have a dataset you'd like to contribute, see this frequently asked question . Selecting task and runs Once you've selected a dataset, you'll be able to choose which task and runs you want to analyze. Currently, we only support analyzing one task at a time. By default, all runs for that task are selected. If you want to select specific runs to analyze, either to only analyses a group of subjects, or to omit certain runs that might have a known issue, you can use the run selector interface. Here you can browse and select specific runs. If you'd like to select groups of runs based on their BIDS entities (e.g. Subject , Run Number , etc..), click on the filter icon at the top of each column. A drop down menu will appear, allowing you to make a selection. Click \"OK\" to apply this filter. You can clear all filters and select all runs by clicking Clear Filters on the bottom left. Saving and unique ID To save your nascent analysis, click on the \"Save\" button. If the button is blue, that means there are unsaved changes.
